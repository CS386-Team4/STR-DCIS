Multiplayer games have been severely lacking in niche multiplayer challenges nowadays and players are constantly looking for new ways to cure boredom. Galactic Gunslingers fills that void as a multiplayer turn-based roguelike that allows gamers to tackle unique challenges with their friends every time they play. For gamers who want a unique mix of an immersive universe full of wild west astronauts along with the intensity of a turn-based roguelike, Galactic Gunslingers will provide just that.
