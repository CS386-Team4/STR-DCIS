## 1. System Description
&emsp;Multiplayer games have been severely lacking in niche challenges nowadays and players are constantly looking for new ways to cure boredom. Galactic Gunslingers fills that void as a turn-based roguelike that allows gamers to tackle unique challenges with their friends every time they play. **Users** can connect to our multiplayer **servers** to find or create a **session** with teammates from around the world. **Profile** creation also allows the **user** to customize and identify with their character. For gamers who want a unique mix of an immersive universe full of wild west astronauts along with the intensity of a turn-based roguelike, Galactic Gunslingers will provide just that.

&emsp;Galactic Gunslingers **users** will download the program from the internet and run it on their **system** <ins>using</ins> our high-*speed* **servers**. In order to run the program, they will need a *computer* that meets certain *graphics* and *operating system* specifications. All **users** will need to either create a new **profile** or sign in to a pre-existing one before accessing the **game**. **Profile** creation will require a *username*, *password*, and *email*. **Developers** can also log in to a **profile** with admin privileges that allows them to perform *testing* and create new *updates*. 

&emsp;Once in the **game**, the **user** will be brought to a main menu where they can change settings, customize their *character*, and <ins>join</ins> new games. Before diving into a **session**, the **user** can <ins>view</ins> their **friends** list along with all of their *statuses*. The **user** can also <ins>send</ins> a **session** *invite* to any of these **friends**. Once in a **session**, they will come across **other users**, new *items*, *enemies*, and *bosses* with variation in *difficulty*. These **other users** will <ins>display</ins> their *active character* to the **user** and the **user** will also have the ability to <ins>send</ins> them a **friend** request. The **user** will also be able to **message** with the **other users** through a <ins>chat box</ins>. The <ins>chat box</ins> contains *mute* and *profanity filter* functions. Once the **game** has finished, all players return to the home screen.
