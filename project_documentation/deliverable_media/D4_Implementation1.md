_Group 04 – “Galactic Gunslingers”\
Date: March 20, 2022\
Group Members: Caroline Fye, Jaron Bauers, Isaiah Raspet, Henry Fye, Jack Normand, Bronwyn Wedig_
## 1. Introduction
The system that has been implemented thus far is a simple single player game that allows players to traverse a start level and fight an enemy. Future implementation will allow for multiplayer and permanent death. As of now, the game consists of a menu screen with buttons for "start game", "settings", and "exit" along with the title Galactic Gunslingers. Background art and music have been added to this menu screen as well. The settings screen currently only has a volume adjuster and a "back" button. Once the "start game" button is selected, the player is brought to a starting level with an animated enemy and more background art. The player can walk towards the enemy and when they collide the battle scene is loaded. This final scene that has been created allows the player to either attack the enemy or heal themselves, with more background art.

## 4. Adopted Technologies
*Unity* 
- A game engine is required to create the game and Unity is very widely used with quite a bit of online information and tutorials. It is also known for being one of the more user friendly engines for beginners in creating video games.\
*Visual Studio*
- C# goes hand-in-hand with Unity making it an obvious choice for the scripts in the game. Visual Studio is also a fairly easy-to-use IDE for writing in C# so it was widely used in writing the scripts for the project.

## 5. Learning and Training
Some of the team members already had some experience with Unity but a vast majority of the learning done for the implementation of this project was conducted through Youtube. There are plenty of tutorials on how to create everything from menu screens to the health bars that were put in the video game. For any questions that go beyond what the Youtube videos showed, forum-type websites were used to find the answers. Two main examples incldue StackOverflow and Unity's own forum on their website. Unity has a decent learning curve at the very start but once the basics were understood was not too big of an issue for the team.
