## 1. Description


## 2. Verification (tests)

**Unit Test**
*2.1.1*
- The framework used to develop our tests was the Unity Test Framework (UTF) which is the built in unit-testing framework in Unity. In order to be able to carry out these "Mock" operations we had to import 4 different plugins from the [Moq website](https://www.nuget.org/packages/moq/).

*2.1.2*
- Link to our unit tests (https://github.com/CS386-Team4/STR-DCIS/tree/main/Source/STR-DCIS/Assets/Tests/EditMode)

*2.1.3*
- Test Case Example: In this example, we unit tested our random dmg generator class in that was added to our Unit c# file. This new class we added utilizes a "Stats" class where our random damage number is being generated. So in our unit test we tested our new class in we made in Unit c# file and mocked the "Stats" class object and manually set the random number generator through mocking it. Then finally made sure that was the correct number we expected.
